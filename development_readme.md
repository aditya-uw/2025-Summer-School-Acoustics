# Development README
Some helpful guidelines for creating code to go into this repository.

**thoughts on python versions**
I (John) have been developing in python 3.12. I think it would be a good idea to choose a single version of python and all use the same version. I'm happy for it to be a different version though depending on other people's needs.

**scientific python** I'm basing the package structure on the current scientific python best practices guidelines. This is a really neat resource that can be found [here](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/)


## pyproject.toml
We can specify python package requirements in the pyproject.toml for the summer school. We can also add extra dependencies for development. The section for this is copied below:

```toml
dependencies = [
  "numpy",
  "scipy",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
  "hatch",
]
```

to install the development dependancies, first navigate to the repository (should be inside folder containing pyproject.toml). Then type this command. (-e flag means editible, which means you can change the code, "." means current directory).

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Documentation
I've (John) set up documentation using sphinx. This allows for any documentation to be written in simple markdown.

### autodoc
If you add a python function or module in `/src/ooi_2025_summer_school_acoustics`, docstrings can be added. I (John) use the [scipy/numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) convention, but am happy to use some other convention if others have a strong opinion. These docstrings will be automatically added to the API documentation. 


Here's an example of the scipy/numpy convention

```python
def csd(data, dim, dB=False, **kwargs):
    '''
    Estimate the cross power spectral density, Pxy, using Welchâ€™s method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : xr.Dataset
        dataset containing data to estimate cross power spectral density.
        must only contain two data variables
    dim : str
        dimension to calculate PSD over
    dB : bool
        if True, return PSD in dB
    kwargs : hashable
        passed to scipy.signal.csd

    Returns
    -------
    csd : xr.DataArray
        cross power spectral density
    '''
```
